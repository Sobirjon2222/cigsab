<h1>I’m a student from Poland and want to learn HTML programming. I think it will be beneficial for my future carrier. But I’ve no job of my own to carry the expenses to pay for the certificate of this course. My parents not together and I live with my mother we don't have a good financial situation; it is very much difficult for me to gather such an amount of money for the certificate. Financial Aid will help me take this course without any adverse impact on my monthly essential needs. So, I’m badly in need of this financial aid. I want to take this course as I want to learn. This course will boost my job prospects after graduation from my university. It will help me perform better in understanding and learning this technology and give me an edge over my competitors. A verified certificate will attach credibility to the certificate I receive from this course. I plan to complete all assignments on or before time.</h1>
